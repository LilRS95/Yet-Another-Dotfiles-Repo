# Yet-Another-Dotfiles-Repo
##A collection of config files for the personal machine of LilRS95

This is currently just a handful of config files pulled from my /home directory. Current plans are as follows:

- Actually bothering to customize the files beyond just basic needs
- Start work on a shell script to add the files to the user's directory
- Add more files to the repo
- ???
- Profit
